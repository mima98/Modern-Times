								<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
								<p>Our mission is to help each and every one of our users achieve their goals and be one step closer to their full potential. We know everyone’s lives are extremely hectic - whether it be school work, your job, or children - and it can be challenging to focus on personal objectives. That is why we created Motivation Station, currently a website but soon to be an app, that socially connects people to motivate each other while doing good for the world. While our ultimate goal is that everyone completes their goals, we understand that it won’t always happen. When that occurs, we hope to utilize Motivation Station as a platform to donate to charities. This way, if our users don’t complete their personal goals, they can still feel empowered in that they are contributing to the societal goal of bettering the world.</p>

										<h2>How It Works<br /></h2>
									</header>
									<p>First, a user chooses a partner based on their friends/social network. From there they choose a challenge, the duration, the frequency, and the "motivation." There are two options for "motivation": you can either potentially give money to your partner, or donate to a charity of your choice. The money is located in a bank account that is connected to the user homepage. Once you have completed your goal, it must be confirmed by your partner. This can be done by sending a picture, a video, or a map location. Once your partner confirms, the money is safely returned to your bank account. If you don't complete your goal, the money is either sent to your partner or directly to a charity.</p>
